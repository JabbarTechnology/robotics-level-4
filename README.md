# Object Tracking AI-Robot

The code for this project is placed in a directory named 'object_tracking' inside the 'earthrover' directory. Rest of the folder contains various modules implemented in the robot and do not pertain to object tracking part.

The ML model used in this project is same as the one used in [previous project](https://github.com/jiteshsaini/object_detection_AI-Robot) i.e. Object Detection.
