# Robotics Level 4

This repo is an extension of previous [level](https://github.com/jiteshsaini/robotics-level-3). It contains projects to show how we can integrate various Machine Learning Models with the robot to achieve following advanced capabilities:-

- Gesture Controls
- Image Classification
- Object Detection 
- Object Tracking
- Human Following


## Object Detection

The code for this project is placed in a directory named 'object_detection' inside the 'earthrover' directory
The ML model used in this project is placed inside 'all_models' directory. 

## Object Tracking
The code for this project is placed in a directory named 'object_tracking' inside the 'earthrover' directory
The ML model used in this project is placed inside 'all_models' directory.  

## Human Following
The code for this project is placed in a directory named 'human_following' inside the 'earthrover' directory
The ML model used in this project is placed inside 'all_models' directory.  

## Image Classification

The code for this project is placed in a directory named 'image_classification' inside the 'earthrover' directory. The directory also contains ML model used for image classification.

## Gesture Control

The code for this project is placed in a directory named 'tm' inside the 'earthrover' directory. 
The model used in this project is trained through Teachable Machine online tool by Google. The model files are present in the same directory. In order to use the code of this project, You will have to train your own model using Teachable Machine tool and download & replace the model files present here.
